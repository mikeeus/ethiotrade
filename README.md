# EthioTradeStats

This webapp was born from my struggle to find tariff rates and import/export records while working at a trading company in Ethiopia.
Although the records are publically available on the [Ethiopian Revenue and Customs authority website](erca.gov.et), they were in excel format which made aggregating the data difficult.
So I created this application to store the data in a searchable database that allows users to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.


The application is composed of a front-end built with Angular2 and generated by the angular-cli. The backend is built with Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database. 

The webapp is hosted on Heroku with the database served by Amazon RDS.


Details:

* Ubuntu 16.04

* Ruby 2.3.1

* Rails 5.0.0.1

* Angular 2.0

* Angular-cli 1.0.0-beta.15

* PostgreSQL 9.5.4 on Amazon RDS

* Hosted on Heroku
