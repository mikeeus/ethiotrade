        <p class="paragraph">This site was built to help (in a small way) solve one of Ethiopia's biggest problems; lack of information.
        </p> 
        <p class="paragraph">Although tariff rates and trade statistics are available publically on the Ethiopian Revenue and Custom's Authority website, it is stored in separate excel files divided up by year. This made finding specific and actionable information a headache, especially if you weren't good with excel formulas.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">So this site was built to bring all of that data into one place and present it in a useful and user-friendly format.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">You can find tariff rates by searching the HS Code or the items description. Or if you want information relating to a specific country, you can select it from the drop down in the header.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In the future, I plan add features such as an annual summary page describing the top countries and HS Codes by import/export volume. Also, I plan to list the HS Codes by their classification groups to make navigating through the data easier.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If there are data formats or specific features that would help you, please reach out to me at hello@mikias.net and I'll do my best to add it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Regardless, any feedback is appreciated! So enjoy the site</p>
